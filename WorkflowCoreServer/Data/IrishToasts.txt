May the best day of your past be the worst day of your future.*
May you live to be a hundred years, with one extra year to repent.*
May there always be work for your hands to do; 
May your purse always hold a coin or two; *
May the sun always shine on your windowpane; 
May a rainbow be certain to follow each rain;*
May the hand of a friend always be near you; 
May God fill your heart with gladness to cheer you.
