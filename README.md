# WorkflowCore with Machine Learning

Sample code to show the use of machine learning (Natural Language Processing) in a fictional conversation between a human (Manuel) and a robot (Otto) powered by WorkflowCore nuget package.This light, yet extremely powerful Nuget package is found under https://github.com/danielgerlag/workflow-core

Down below is a diagram of the implementation that shows the steps involved in the exchange of messages involving a machine (Otto) and a human operator (Manuel.) The steps are a combination of:
1) System messages, issues by the "robotic" operator;
2) Custom messages, issued by the human operator;
3) Event Data triggering activities in the workflow
